3. There are four controls provided in the game:
    a) New: To create a new puzzle grid.
    b) Reset: Remove all the entries made in the puzzle grid.
    c) Flag: Flag a cell in case multiple entries are possible for the current cell.
    d) Undo: Remove the last entry. Hold the button to remove all the entries utill the last flagged cell.

Application files:
--------------------
There are two projects in the application:
1. SuDoKuGenerator: This creates the random Sudoku puzzle.
2. SuDoKu: This generates the UI and all the front end logic to present the puzzle grid.

The SuDoKuGenerator needs to be built first and the corresponding dll should be referred to the SuDoKu project before building the same.
